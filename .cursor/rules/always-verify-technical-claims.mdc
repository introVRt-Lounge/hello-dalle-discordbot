# Always Verify Technical Claims Before Making Statements

## Rule: Never Make Claims Without Verification

**NEVER** make statements about technical status, workflow results, or system behavior without **first checking the actual state**.

## What This Means

❌ **BAD** - Making assumptions:
- "The workflow is working perfectly"
- "All issues are complete and functional"
- "The deployment succeeded"
- "The bot is running correctly"

✅ **GOOD** - Always verify first:
- Check workflow runs: `mcp_GitHub_MCP_Server_list_workflow_runs()`
- Examine logs: `mcp_GitHub_MCP_Server_get_workflow_run_logs()`
- Test functionality: Run actual commands
- Check PR status: `mcp_GitHub_MCP_Server_get_pull_request()`

## Verification Steps Required

Before making **ANY** claim about:
- ✅ Workflow status
- ✅ Deployment success
- ✅ Code functionality
- ✅ System behavior
- ✅ Issue resolution status

**ALWAYS** run the appropriate verification command first.

## Examples of Required Verification

### Workflow Claims
```bash
# Before saying "workflow is working"
gh run list --repo owner/repo --limit 1
# OR
mcp_GitHub_MCP_Server_list_workflow_runs()
```

### PR Status Claims
```bash
# Before saying "PR is ready"
gh pr view 123 --repo owner/repo
# OR
mcp_GitHub_MCP_Server_get_pull_request()
```

### Issue Resolution Claims
```bash
# Before saying "issue is complete"
gh issue view 123 --repo owner/repo
# OR
mcp_GitHub_MCP_Server_get_issue()
```

## Consequences of Breaking This Rule

- ❌ User mistrust due to incorrect information
- ❌ Wasted time debugging false positives
- ❌ Poor decision making based on assumptions
- ❌ Professional credibility damage

## Always Ask Yourself

**"Have I actually checked this, or am I assuming based on previous knowledge?"**

If you're not 100% certain from recent verification, **check again**.
