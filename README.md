This bot uses OpenAI's DALL-E to generate welcome images for new Discord members. It describes the user's avatar and generates an image based on a prompt. Additionally, for users without a profile pic, it will generate a profile pic based on their username and suggest the user adopt it.

## Features
- **Welcome Images for New Members**: Automatically generates and sends a welcome image when new members join your server.
- **Profile Picture Suggestion for New Members Without an Avatar**: For users without a profile picture, the bot will create one based on their username and suggest it as their profile picture.
- **Gender Sensitivity Option**: Attempts to add personalized touches to generated images based on very limited perceivable characteristics. This is an optional feature, designed to make generated images more accurate. This feature must be explicitly enabled using an environment variable (`GENDER_SENSITIVITY`).
- **Image Generation**: Uses OpenAI's DALL-E to generate images and re-uploads them to Discord to avoid expiration.
- **Wildcard Feature**: Introduces variability in the prompts with a configurable chance of using an alternate prompt (default is 0% / disabled. 99 is max for 99% likely).
- **Image Storage**: Saves generated welcome images to a `welcome_images` subfolder with filenames based on the username and timestamp.
- **Delay Feature**: Configurable delay (default 2 minutes) before posting the welcome image to the `welcome` channel. The bot will inform admins in `#botspam` about the delay before the image is posted.
- **Stealth Welcome Messages**: Optionally configure the bot to post welcome messages in the `welcome` channel as silent messages, notifying only the new user without pinging everyone else. This can be controlled via the `STEALTH_WELCOME` environment variable.
- **Configurable Channels**: Allows specifying different channels for welcome images (`WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID`) and profile picture suggestions (`PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID`). These channels can be the same, at the user's discretion.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Docker (optional)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```plaintext
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
BOTSPAM_CHANNEL_ID=your_botspam_channel_id
WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID=your_welcome_channel_id  # Required: Channel ID where welcome images are posted.
PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID=your_profile_channel_id  # Required: Channel ID where profile picture suggestions are posted (typically #general).
BOT_USER_ROLE=your_bot_user_role_id  # Required: Role ID that allows users to use the /pfp command.
WELCOME_PROMPT=Create a welcome image for a new Discord user with the username '{username}'. Incorporate the user's avatar into the image, its described as: {avatar}
WILDCARD=0
POSTING_DELAY=120  # Delay in seconds before posting the image to the welcome channel
WATERMARK_PATH=/usr/src/app/watermark.png  # Optional: path for a watermark image that will be added to welcome images. If not set, no watermark will be added. Add as a docker bind path to store the watermark image on your host.
STEALTH_WELCOME=false  # Optional: Set to 'true' to enable stealth mode, making welcome messages in the welcome channel silent for everyone except the new user.
GENDER_SENSITIVITY=false # Optional: Set to 'true' to enable personalized touches for generated images based on gender-sensitive characteristics.
```

## Cost

Using the bot incurs costs based on the usage of OpenAI's DALL-E APIs. Each welcome image generated costs approximately $0.03. Ensure you monitor your usage to manage costs effectively.

## Debugging and Control

### Botspam Channel

The "botspam" channel is a designated channel in your Discord server where your bots can post detailed logs, debug information, and other outputs. When we reference `#botspam`, it refers to this designated channel where your bots will "spam" you with updates and logs. You will need to specify the ID of your botspam channel in the `.env` file.

### Slash Commands

The bot now uses modern Discord slash commands (`/`) instead of the old `!` commands. The bot recognizes the following slash commands:

#### Profile Picture Commands

- `/pfp username:<username> [override:<custom_prompt>] [private:<true|false>]`: Generates a profile picture suggestion for a specific user. Can be used in `#botspam`, `#welcome`, or `#general` channels. Requires admin privileges or the designated role ID (set in `BOT_USER_ROLE`) unless `/pfp-anyone` is enabled. **Username field has autocomplete support.**
  - `username`: The username of the user to generate a profile picture for (required)
  - `override`: Custom prompt to use instead of the default username-based prompt (optional)
  - `private`: If `true`, the override prompt is not revealed publicly. Defaults to `false`.

**Note**: The old `!pfp` command is deprecated and no longer supported. Use `/pfp` instead.

- `/pfp-anyone`: Toggles whether regular users can use the `/pfp` command. Only works in the `#botspam` channel. Admin command only.

#### Welcome Commands

- `/welcome username:<username> destination:<channel>`: Manually trigger a welcome message for a specific user. Requires admin privileges or the designated role ID (set in `BOT_USER_ROLE`). **Username field has autocomplete support.**
  - `username`: The username of the user to welcome (required)
  - `destination`: Where to send the welcome message (required)
    - `Welcome Channel (Default)`: Posts to the configured welcome channel
    - `Botspam Channel (Debug/Test)`: Posts to botspam channel for testing/debugging

#### Configuration Commands

- `/wildcard value:<number>`: Set the wildcard chance to a specific value between 0 and 99. This command allows you to control the variability in the welcome prompts. Only works in the `#botspam` channel.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
/pfp username: JohnDoe
/pfp username: JohnDoe override: a futuristic cyborg with glowing blue eyes private: false
/pfp-anyone
/welcome username: JaneSmith destination: Welcome Channel (Default)
/wildcard value: 25
```

### Autocomplete Feature

The `/pfp` and `/welcome` commands now include **autocomplete functionality** for the username parameter. When you type `/welcome username:` or `/pfp username:`, Discord will show a dropdown list of all server members that match what you've typed so far. This makes it much easier to find and select the correct user without having to remember exact usernames.

The autocomplete searches through both usernames and display names, so you can find users more easily.

### Migration from Old Commands

The bot has been converted from using `!` commands to modern Discord slash commands. The old `!` commands are no longer supported. Users should now use the `/` commands instead for better Discord integration, auto-completion, and help text.
