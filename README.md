This bot uses OpenAI's DALL-E to generate welcome images for new Discord members. It describes the user's avatar and generates an image based on a prompt. Additionally, for users without a profile pic, it will generate a profile pic based on their username and suggest the user adopt it.

## Features
- **Welcome Images for New Members**: Automatically generates and sends a welcome image when new members join your server.
- **Profile Picture Suggestion for New Members Without an Avatar**: For users without a profile picture, the bot will create one based on their username and suggest it as their profile picture.
- **Gender Sensitivity Option**: Attempts to add personalized touches to generated images based on very limited perceivable characteristics. This is an optional feature, designed to make generated images more accurate. This feature must be explicitly enabled using an environment variable (`GENDER_SENSITIVITY`).
- **Image Generation**: Uses OpenAI's DALL-E to generate images and re-uploads them to Discord to avoid expiration.
- **Wildcard Feature**: Introduces variability in the prompts with a configurable chance of using an alternate prompt (default is 0% / disabled. 99 is max for 99% likely).
- **Image Storage**: Saves generated welcome images to a `welcome_images` subfolder with filenames based on the username and timestamp.
- **Delay Feature**: Configurable delay (default 2 minutes) before posting the welcome image to the `welcome` channel. The bot will inform admins in `#botspam` about the delay before the image is posted.
- **Stealth Welcome Messages**: Optionally configure the bot to post welcome messages in the `welcome` channel as silent messages, notifying only the new user without pinging everyone else. This can be controlled via the `STEALTH_WELCOME` environment variable.
- **Configurable Channels**: Allows specifying different channels for welcome images (`WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID`) and profile picture suggestions (`PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID`). These channels can be the same, at the user's discretion.

## Installation

```

### Running with Docker

For details on running this project with Docker, visit the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/heavygee/hello-dalle-discordbot).

## Image Generation Engines

This bot supports two image generation engines:

### DALL-E (Default)
- Uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model
- High-quality, consistent results
- Requires OpenAI API key with credits

### Google Gemini (Optional)
- Uses Google's Gemini models with "Nano Banana" (limited free tier)
- Supports both text-to-image and **image-to-image** generation
- Limited free tier (~2 images/day), paid tier for higher usage
- Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable

üìñ **Detailed Flow Documentation**: [IMAGE-GENERATION-FLOWS.md](IMAGE-GENERATION-FLOWS.md) - Complete technical documentation with flowcharts showing how DALL-E and Gemini differ in production

#### Gemini Features
- **Text-to-Image**: Generate images from text prompts
- **Image-to-Image**: Transform existing images (welcome images use actual user avatars)
- **PFP Enhancement**: Use `use-existing-pfp` flag to transform user's current Discord avatar
- **Cost Effective**: Limited free tier with Nano Banana model

#### Gemini Commands
```bash
# Use Gemini for text-to-image
/pfp Make me look like a cyberpunk hacker engine:gemini

# Use Gemini with existing avatar transformation
/pfp Transform my avatar into something magical use-existing-pfp engine:gemini

# Welcome command with Gemini (uses actual user avatar)
/welcome username:testuser engine:gemini
```

## Cost

### DALL-E (Default)
Using DALL-E incurs costs based on OpenAI's API pricing. Standard 1024√ó1024 images cost approximately **$0.04 per image**. Monitor your OpenAI usage dashboard to manage costs effectively.

### Google Gemini (Optional)
- **Free Tier**: Limited free tier (~2 images/day) with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
- **Paid Tier**: **$0.039 per image** for 1024√ó1024 outputs
- **Development**: Suitable for testing but limited for production use

Choose Gemini for cost-effective image generation, especially for servers with moderate usage.

## Debugging and Control

### Botspam Channel

The "botspam" channel is a designated channel in your Discord server where your bots can post detailed logs, debug information, and other outputs. When we reference `#botspam`, it refers to this designated channel where your bots will "spam" you with updates and logs. You will need to specify the ID of your botspam channel in the `.env` file.

### Slash Commands

The bot now uses modern Discord slash commands (`/`) instead of the old `!` commands. The bot recognizes the following slash commands:

#### Profile Picture Commands

- `/pfp username:<username> [override:<custom_prompt>] [engine:<engine_choice>] [use-existing-pfp:<true/false>]`: Generates a profile picture suggestion for a specific user. Can be used in `#botspam`, `#welcome`, or `#general` channels. Requires admin privileges or the designated role ID (set in `BOT_USER_ROLE`) unless `/pfp-anyone` is enabled. **Username field has autocomplete support.**
  - `username`: The username of the user to generate a profile picture for (required)
  - `override`: Custom prompt to use instead of the default username-based prompt (optional)
  - `engine`: Override the default image generation engine for this command (optional)
  - `use-existing-pfp`: Transform the user's current Discord avatar instead of generating from scratch (optional, works with both DALL-E and Gemini)

**Note**: The old `!pfp` command is deprecated and no longer supported. Use `/pfp` instead.

- `/pfp-anyone`: Toggles whether regular users can use the `/pfp` command. Only works in the `#botspam` channel. Admin command only.

#### Welcome Commands

- `/welcome username:<username> destination:<channel> [engine:<engine_choice>]`: Manually trigger a welcome message for a specific user. Requires admin privileges or the designated role ID (set in `BOT_USER_ROLE`). **Username field has autocomplete support.**
  - `username`: The username of the user to welcome (required)
  - `destination`: Where to send the welcome message (required)
    - `Welcome Channel (Default)`: Posts to the configured welcome channel
    - `Botspam Channel (Debug/Test)`: Posts to botspam channel for testing/debugging
  - `engine`: Override the default image generation engine for this command (optional)

#### Configuration Commands

- `/wildcard value:<number>`: Set the wildcard chance to a specific value between 0 and 99. This command allows you to control the variability in the welcome prompts. Only works in the `#botspam` channel.
- `/engine engine:<choice>`: Set the default image generation engine to either "DALL-E (OpenAI)" or "Gemini (Google)". This affects all image generation when no specific engine is specified in commands. Only works in the `#botspam` channel.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
/pfp username: JohnDoe
/pfp username: JohnDoe override: a futuristic cyborg with glowing blue eyes
/pfp username: JohnDoe engine: Gemini (Google)
/pfp username: JohnDoe use-existing-pfp: true engine: Gemini (Google)
/pfp username: JaneSmith use-existing-pfp: true engine: DALL-E (OpenAI)
/pfp-anyone
/welcome username: JaneSmith destination: Welcome Channel (Default)
/welcome username: JaneSmith destination: Welcome Channel (Default) engine: DALL-E (OpenAI)
/wildcard value: 25
/engine engine: Gemini (Google)
```

### Autocomplete Feature

The `/pfp` and `/welcome` commands now include **autocomplete functionality** for the username parameter. When you type `/welcome username:` or `/pfp username:`, Discord will show a dropdown list of all server members that match what you've typed so far. This makes it much easier to find and select the correct user without having to remember exact usernames.

The autocomplete searches through both usernames and display names, so you can find users more easily.

### Migration from Old Commands

The bot has been converted from using `!` commands to modern Discord slash commands. The old `!` commands are no longer supported. Users should now use the `/` commands instead for better Discord integration, auto-completion, and help text.
