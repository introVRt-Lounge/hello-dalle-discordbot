## Features & Fixes

### 🔧 Discord Bot Improvements
- **Fix autocomplete timeout issues**: Resolve GuildMembersTimeout and Unknown interaction errors
- Use cached guild members first for instant responses
- Implement 2-second timeout protection with graceful fallback
- Prevent interaction token expiration and failed responses

- **Optimize pfp command member fetching**: Use same smart pattern as welcome command
- Check cache first, then targeted fetch with 3-second timeout
- Prevent timeouts when finding users not in autocomplete cache

### 🚀 Deployment Automation (Currently Disabled)
- **Temporarily disabled**: Coolify webhook deployment trigger commented out due to IP restrictions
- **Preserved for future**: Code ready to re-enable once IP restrictions are resolved
- **Webhook approach**: Uses Coolify native webhooks instead of direct API calls
- **Secrets configured**: COOLIFY_WEBHOOK and COOLIFY_TOKEN ready for use

### 🛡️ Development Workflow Improvements
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Set up husky + lint-staged for automatic TypeScript validation
- **Enhanced CI/CD**: npm test now includes TypeScript compilation to catch errors early
- **TypeScript fixes**: Updated tsconfig.json and fixed import issues for better compatibility
- **Quality gates**: Automated checks prevent broken commits

### 📋 Workflow Changes
- Docker Hub push only (removed GHCR)
- Uses `latest` tag for deployment tracking
- Generic deployment template for repository forks
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (preserved)

## Status
- ✅ **Autocomplete fixes**: Ready to merge
- ✅ **Pfp command optimization**: Ready to merge  
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks**: Ready to merge
- ✅ **TypeScript validation**: Ready to merge
- ⏸️ **Deployment automation**: Disabled until IP restrictions resolved

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Pre-commit hooks validated
- No linting errors
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Now with pre-commit validation:
git add file.ts
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
# → Automatically runs TypeScript compilation on staged files
# → Blocks commit if errors found
# → Ensures CI always passes
```

Fixes production timeout issues and prevents future TypeScript compilation errors.
